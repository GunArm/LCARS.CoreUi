# LCARS.CoreUi
LCARS ui building tools with c# winforms

For now an in-progress c# recreation of the LCARS x32 library containing core LCARS ui elements and their winform drawing mechanics.
Each VB.NET file run through a auto-converter and then manually fixed to working, with some cleanup and refactors in the process.
